# Body Biasing in Schmitt Trigger - CMOS VLSI Mini Project

This repository contains a mini project titled **"Body Biasing in Schmitt Trigger"**, submitted as part of the CMOS VLSI Circuits (20EC630) course at JSS Science and Technology University.


##  Tools Used
- **Cadence Virtuoso** â€“ for schematic and simulation
- 90nm Technology node

##  Objectives
- Analyze transient response of Schmitt Trigger with and without body biasing
- Evaluate DC response and hysteresis behavior under different biasing
- Compare rise/fall times and threshold voltages

##  Key Results

| Parameter                       | Conventional | Body Biased |
|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Rise Time                     | 0.39 ns      | 23.357 ns   |
| Fall Time                     | 0.15 ns      | 22.699 ns   |
| High to Low Voltage Threshold | 1.039 V      | 717 mV      |
| Low to High Voltage Threshold | 587 mV       | 698 mV      |

##  Learnings
- Body biasing allows dynamic control of threshold voltage
- Trade-off between speed and noise immunity
- Crucial for designing reliable circuits in low-power applications
